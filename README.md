# Classes: 
- Piece
  - Attributes:
    - Board board
    - BoardSquare square
    - string Color
    - char/int Rank
    - int Range -- Normally 1, 10 for rank == 9, 0 for rank == Flag and rank == Bomb
    - pair/tuple Position
    - boolean Alive
    - boolean Attacks -- True for everything but rank == Flag and rank == Bomb
    - image Piece
    - image Insignia
  - Functions:
    - int Attack(Piece) -- returns -1 for dies, 1 for kills, 0 for draw
    - boolean Move(Position) -- checks to see if it can move to position, if so moves there, attacks if neccesary
    - void Die() -- informs board of death, tells square to kill it
- BoardSquare
  - Attributes:
    - Piece Occupant = Null -- Defaults to Null ***We may have to make a blank piece instead of using Null
    - pair/tuple Position
    - boolean Water = False -- Only water spaces <So a square is moveable through only if Occupant == Null and Water == False>
  - Functions:
    - void MakePiece(int Rank, string Color) -- Occupant = Piece(Color,Rank)
    - void ClearPiece() -- Occupant = Null
- Board
  - Attributes:
    - BoardSquare[10][10] Squares
    - string Mode -- Conditions include "Start" "Placement1" "Placement2" "Playing" "Victory"
    - string Turn -- Red or Blue
    - int[10] RedPieces -- 0 == bomb, 1-9, Stores the number of each piece still in the game
    - int[10] BluePeces
    - jlabel[20] Pools -- For the pieces arrays to print in the "Combatant" Boxes
  - Functions:
    - void SetupMatch() --
    - ***void LoadMatch() --
    - ***void SaveMatch() --
    - void Flip() -- Turns off all pieces that are showing, turns on all pieces that aren't
    - void CheckGameover() -- Makes sure there is a viable move to be made (in Stratego it's gameover if you can't move)
    - void GetMove() -- Gets the players move and checks it for compliance 
    - void UpdatePools()
    - void AcceptDeath(int rank) -- Called when a piece dies, decrements its rank
    - void Muster() -- Calls all pieces and tallies their ranks, resetting RedPieces and BluePieces
    - void FlagCapture(string Color) -- Color has captured the other teams flag and wins.

  - Attributes:
